# @todo
- Do not create irrelevant cells
- Destroy rendered and irrelevant cells
  - Irrelevant meaning that have the highest entropy
- Add noise map for randomizing weights
- Fix floating point precision on scaling (add rounding to output)
- Deploy to aws s3 and serve via cloudfront
- Process more waves than fps if computational power allows for that
  - This should be a setting
  - Perhaps when fps is "unlimited"
- Remove weird artifact from loader
